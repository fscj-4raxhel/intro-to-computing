# intro-to-computing
Review of the first computer science course in university.

## Why?
I need a profession. And I choose software engineering as my next step. The hard part of landing a job as professional software engineer is my previous experience. I learned computer science in university combining economics. However, I proceeded to pursue a M.A economics degree. Although my first job was a SWE and data scientist, my second job was a technical support engineer at a hot start up.

I love computer science and programming. And I understand and can code, better than some "professional" SWEs that I know. BUT, these are just internal. Hiring managers look for external evidence, academic backgroun, previous work experience, and projects. Unfortunately, I stretched myself too thin.

Going one level deeper, I found my fundations are not as solid as I wanted. So I decided to take the time to consolidate it.

## Philosophy
Slow is fast.

Do anyhing out of love not utility.

Deep knowledge and altruistic projects. Shallow knowledge promots illustion of competence, self-centered projects comes from selfish people.
