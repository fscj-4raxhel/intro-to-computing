# Types and Expressions
Computers are very good at performing computations. Every thing a computer can do relies on digitalization which is the process to representing information in binary form.

## Numbers
Thanks to compilers, we human beings can work directly with decimals (10 based numbers), something that we are used to leaving the tedius work of dealing with binary number to the ALU.
