# Pictures
Computer graphics is the study of creation and manipulation of images, still and moving. The most common representation of picture is as pixels, which are made up of RGB-triples. Manipulation of picture is then the modifiction of the color of pixels. And this process involes a sequencing through a collection. We will use a while loop to iterate the pixels of the picture and use if statement to decide whether or not to perform some actions.
