# Java Programs
Java like any high-level programming language is defined for a specific purpose -- write computre programs. So it has grammatical rules that everyone involved in Java, from compiler writer to programmer, must follow. They must have a clear understanding of the rules.

Recall that a program express an algorithm, a procedure of doing something, as a series of steps, or statements, in certain programming language, which in our case is Java. Programmers reuses code and open perform actions repeatedly. There are means to facilitate both needs.

## Java
Java is well known for its platform independence, a.k.a. "write once run anywhere". This feature rooted at the early design criterion. Back to the early 90's, Java was designed for embedded systesm, especially the set-top box for interactive TV. Those systesm undergo change of processor in response to change in market conditon. So platform independence was very reasonable design choice.

Java happend to come along at about the same time as the World Wide Web. Using a plaform independent language HTML, a web-browser can run on any machine and download and display the web pages from server described by the HTML. Soon after, people find that dynamic pages wich which the users can interact are more interesting. There was a call for a programming language that can run in the browser. A special kind of Java program called Applet was the perfect fit for it. It earned Java a lot of interests and hype.

We choose Java not because of interesting web programming or embedded programming. We choose Java because it's a modern language that supports the object-oriented paradigm of programming and its design is simple and safe comparing C++.

In object-oriented programming, we use object to represent real-world entities and design the system to model its real-world counterpart.
