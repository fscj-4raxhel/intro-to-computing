# Java Programs
Java like any high-level programming language is defined for a specific purpose -- write computre programs. So it has grammatical rules that everyone involved in Java, from compiler writer to programmer, must follow. They must have a clear understanding of the rules.

Recall that a program express an algorithm, a procedure of doing something, as a series of steps, or statements, in certain programming language, which in our case is Java. Programmers reuses code and open perform actions repeatedly. There are means to facilitate both needs.
