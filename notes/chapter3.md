# Methods
In this chapter we will learn: method declarations, method invovation, parameterized methods, and functions.

## Methods and abstractions
As the problem gets larger and larger, composition by nesting gets harder and harder to manage. We need a mechanism to address code reuse issue much better than nesting loops.

Abstraction, is an important and common way to deal with complexity in programming. The first and simplist form of abstraction in computer science is the use of procedural abstraction -- ignoring details and differences and focusing on similarities.

A method, a.k.a. procedure in other programming languages, is a named sequence of instructions that can be referenced in other places in the program through method invovation statements.
